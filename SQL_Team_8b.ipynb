    "\n",
    "**Business Problem:**\n",
    "Analyze the relationship between COVID-19 and its effects on types of crime, locations and frequencies of crime. Understand the patterns of crime that were taking place in Chicago and how they changed in relation to city shut-downs. In addition, we are working on obtaining a dataset regarding the police excessive use of force and complaints and connection with the crimes and crime rates. *note: we did not receive the data set in time.*\n",

    " \n",
    " > **Steps in advance:**\n",
    " > - Extracted data from larger data sets and saved them in new tables (named above)\n",
    " > - Converted the timestamp in the chicago_crime_2014_2020 into a date format to match the format with the other tables\n",
    " \n",
    " > **Restrictions and Limitations:**\n",
    " > - Chicago Crime Data Set: The addresses of the crimes are appromixate as part of the address is marked out with Xs, so analysis of different situations and zip codes are approximated over various areas. Another limitation is the documentation of in primary types of crime because there are two labels, \"Criminal Sexual Assualt\" and \"Crim Sexual Assualt\" that presumably indicate the same type of crime but becuase they are seperated it is hard to know if they were actually meant to represent the same crime. Last point is that data is directly reported about crimes by police, so data could be biased.\n",
    " > - Chicago Covid-19 Data Set: The reporting date of the Covid-19 case is not the date of illness, and there is also the incubation period when the person may already be contagious but does not yet know that they have the virus. It is therefore possible that, especially with regard to the weekly comparison, there is a time lag that cannot be identified.\n",

    "The analysis of the different datasets has shown that a connection between Covid-19 and the crimes in Chicago can indeed be established. In general, the following analysis shows that the crimes in 2020 are significantly lower compared to the average crimes of the last 6 years. Especially in the months when the corona virus was new in the USA, the number of crimes decreased up to 69.7%. By comparing the number of different types of crimes in 2019 and 2020, we found that the top 5 crime types in 2019 and 2020 are the same. However, in 2020, the number of crimes of the top 5 crimes type has dropped significantly, with theft dropping the most by 31%. The same thing occurred at the crime location. By comparing the number of crimes in different locations in 2019 and 2020, the number of crimes on sidewalk dropped the most by 33%. It should be noted that the analysis was not comprehensive enough to attribute the decline in crimes exclusively to the corona virus.In addition, arrested rate decreased caused by Covid-19 since police strike and avoiding the spread of Covid-19 in the prison. Lastly, while overall crime rates went down, we found that domestic violence overall increased by 3% from 2019 to 2020 as well as specific crimes associated with domestic violence also increased."

Interestingly, the number of crimes among different crime types decreased over time. In 2020, since COVID-19 started, Theft has been decreasing by 31.06% which is the largest decrease among the top 5 crime types. Deceptive Practice has been decreasing by 25.16% which is the second biggest decrease. The third is Battery(-14.73%), the forth is Assault(-11.90%) and the fifth is Criminal Damage(-5.60%). The biggest impact of COVID-19 on daily life is that it reduced the frequency and time spent going out. We can see that under this condition, the theft, which is often related to going out has the biggest decrease among the top 5 crime types."

The third is small retail stores(-15.93%), the fourth is on or near the street(-14.04%) and the fifth is apartments(-0.57%). Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, people are staying indoors most of the time, which reduces the number of crimes that occur outdoors or in public places such as sidewalks, small retail stores and streets. Moreover, COVID-19 requires social distancing between people and reduced gatherings which may also be the reason for the decline in crime rates in residence and apartment locations."

    "Between 2019 and 2020 the arrested rate for crimes went down. COVID-19 caused lots of changes in Chicago including a police strike and the decrease in arrested rates in Chicago. In order to make the conclusion that the arrested rate decreased due to COVID-19 we need to eliminate some other factors that may also cause the arrested rate to decrease such as the overall crime numbers decreasing and an increase in crimes which may not be very serious and often don't get arrested. Using the queries below, we can eliminate these factors because although primary types of crimes change and arrested rates change for all primary types that decreased, the arrested rate change was much higher than the primary type of crime change indicating that if two people made the same mistake in 2019 and 2020, there is a greater chance of being arrested in 2019. This is caused by COVID-19 and the reduced number of police. Another reason for the disproportionate decrease in arrest rates is nearly 16% of Illinois COVID-19 cases were linked to outbreaks from Chicago jail so the government reduced the arrested rate to avoid the spread of COVID-19 in the prison according to a study.
